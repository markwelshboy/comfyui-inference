ERROR: Cannot install numpy<2.0.0 and >=1.18 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested numpy<2.0.0 and >=1.18
    The user requested (constraint) numpy<2.3,>=2

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
